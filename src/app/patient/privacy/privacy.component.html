<p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential Cookies.&nbsp;Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested.&nbsp;For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into the secure areas of our Services.&nbsp;Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</li>

<li>Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.&nbsp;Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.&nbsp;For more information about this, please see the section below titled &ldquo;Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Web Beacons.&nbsp;Web Beacons&nbsp;(e.g., clear GIFs or pixel tags)&nbsp;are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the web services of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send.&nbsp;The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers&rsquo; web services or opening emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising&nbsp;(discussed further below).</li>
<li>Mobile Device Identifiers.&nbsp;Mobile device identifiers help Ischedulenow learn more about our users&rsquo; demographics and internet behaviors.&nbsp;Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it.&nbsp;Mobile device identifiers enable collection of Personal Data&nbsp;(such as media access control, address and location, and tracking data, including without limitation IP address, domain server, type of device(s)&nbsp;used to access the Services, web browser(s)&nbsp;used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services).</li>
<li>Cross Device Matching.&nbsp;To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information&nbsp;(including demographic, geographic and interest-based data).&nbsp;To supplement this analysis, we may also provide de-identified data to these partners.&nbsp;Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your browser may offer you a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.&nbsp;Not all browsers offer a Do Not Track option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a Do Not Track signal.&nbsp;Please note that, for these reasons and because of our use of Cookies, our Services, like many website operators, do not support &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; requests sent from a browser at this time.&nbsp;To find out more about &ldquo;Do Not Track,&rdquo; you can visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.com/"><strong>www.allaboutdnt.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:</strong></p>
<p>We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services.&nbsp;These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors&nbsp;(&ldquo;Interest-Based Ads&rdquo;).&nbsp;Information for Interest-Based Ads&nbsp;(including Personal Data)&nbsp;may be provided to us by you, or derived or inferred from the online activity or usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties.&nbsp;Such information may include IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic information, such as gender and age range.&nbsp;Such information may be gathered through tracking users&rsquo; activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services.&nbsp;To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including Web Beacons, from an ad network to you through the Services.&nbsp;Web Beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.&nbsp;This information helps Ischedulenow learn more about our users&rsquo; demographics and internet behaviors.&nbsp;Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.&nbsp;Web Beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
<p>We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;(&ldquo;DAA&rdquo;)&nbsp;Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.&nbsp;Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;(&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer&rsquo;s online behavior across different websites and properties.&nbsp;To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA&rsquo;s or NAI&rsquo;s consumer opt-out pages, which are located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><strong>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</strong></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices"><strong>www.aboutads.info/choices</strong></a>, or install the DAA&rsquo;s AppChoice app&nbsp;(for&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8"><strong>iOS</strong></a>; for&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&amp;hl=en"><strong>Android</strong></a>)&nbsp;on your mobile computing device.&nbsp;When you use these opt-out features, an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; Cookie will be placed on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device indicating that you do not want to receive Interest-Based Ads from NAI or DAA member companies.&nbsp;If you delete Cookies on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device, you may need to opt out again.&nbsp;For information about how to opt out of Interest-Based Ads on mobile devices, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device"><strong>http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device</strong></a>.&nbsp;You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.</p>
<p>Please note that even after opting out of Interest-Based Ads, you may still see Ischedulenow advertisements that are not interest-based&nbsp;(i.e., not targeted toward you).&nbsp;Also, opting out does not mean that Ischedulenow is no longer using tracking tools &mdash; Ischedulenow still may collect information about your use of the Services even after you have opted out of Interest-Based Ads and may still serve advertisements to you via the Services based on information collected via the Services.</p>
